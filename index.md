## Final Project FAQ

### Is this a team project?

- These are not team projects. Each student will work on a single project.  Students can share ideas about a project but not code.  

### I have a great idea for an app.  Do I have to use one of these predefined user stories?

No.  You are free to create whatever you like.  The advantage of using a predefined user story is the built in guidance for the scope, functionality, data, and application structure.

### Can two students work on the same application/user story?

- 1 student per project.  No sharing code.
- Different students can choose the same predefined user story.
