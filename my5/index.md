# My 5 User Stories

> As a _type of user_, I want _some goal_ so that _some reason_.

## Overview

A website that allows users to post their top 5 favorite things and allows friends the ability to provide their opinions via votes and comments.  Associated with the top 5 lists, a blog provides insights into how the top 5 was formed.  Blog posts can have comments which can be voted upon.  Visitors can view lists and comments but can not vote or add a comment.  Users can create lists, vote and comment.

## View Categories

As a user (visitor or user) I want to browse the lists by their list category such as:

- Music
- Movies
- Books
- Top Relationship fails

Once I select a category, I am directed to the **Lists** page where I see a list of lists.  How meta!

## Display Lists

As a user, I want to view a list of all the lists for a specific category.  Each item in the list should display the following:

- List Name (Ex: Top 5 Beatles Albums)
- List Description (Ex: The definitive list of the best 5 Beatles Albums.  Let the debate begin!)

Once I select a list, I am directed to the **Lists Items** page.

## Create List Blog Post

As a creator of a list, I want the ability to create a blog post in order to provide my thoughts on how I came up with the items on a given list.

## Create Blog Post comments

As a user, I want the ability to comment on a given blog post.  

## Vote on Blog Post Comments

As a user I want the ability to provide either an up vote (+1) or down vote (-1) for a given blog post comment.

## Display List Items

As a user, I want to view all the list items for a specific list.  Each item in the list should display the following:

- List Item Name (Ex: Magical Mystery Tour)
- List Item Creator Rank
- Voter Rank - A sum of the up and down votes for a list item.

## Vote on List Item

As a user who did not create a list, I want the ability to provide either an up vote (+1) or down vote (-1) for an item on the **Lists Items** page.
