# My 5 User Stories

> As a _type of user_, I want _some goal_ so that _some reason_.

## Overview

A website that allows users to post their top 5 favorite things and allows friends the ability to provide their opinions via votes and comments.  Associated with the top 5 lists, a blog provides insights into how the top 5 was formed.  Blog posts can have comments which can be voted upon.  Visitors can view lists and comments but can not vote or add a comment.  Users can create lists, vote and comment.

## View Categories

As a visitor or authenticated user, I want to browse the lists by their list category such as:

As a visitor or authenticated user, I am directed to the **Lists** page where I see a list of lists.  How meta!

## Display Lists

As a visitor or authenticated user, I want to view a list of all the lists for a specific category.  Each item in the list should display the following:

- List Name (Ex: Top 5 Beatles Albums)

Once I select a list, I am directed to the **Lists Items** page.
